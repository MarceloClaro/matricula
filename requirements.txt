# Face Recognition Dependencies (OPTIONAL)
# These are NOT included in requirements.txt to prevent deployment issues on Streamlit Cloud
# dlib compilation takes 5-10 minutes and may timeout, blocking installation of other packages
# 
# To enable face recognition features:
# - For local development: pip install -r requirements-face.txt
# - For Streamlit Cloud: Copy the dependencies from requirements-face.txt 
#   and add them to this file, then redeploy
# 
# The application works fully without these dependencies.
# Face recognition features will be gracefully disabled if not installed.
# See requirements-face.txt and FACE_RECOGNITION_INSTALLATION.md for details.

# Optional advanced features for face recognition (anti-spoofing, data augmentation)
# To enable these features, install: pip install -r requirements-optional.txt
# See FACE_RECOGNITION_INSTALLATION.md for complete installation instructions
