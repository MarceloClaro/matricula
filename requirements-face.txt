# Face Recognition Dependencies (Optional)
# These libraries require system dependencies and may take time to compile
# Install these separately after requirements.txt
#
# Prerequisites (Ubuntu/Debian):
#   sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev \
#                        libx11-dev libgtk-3-dev libatlas-base-dev gfortran
#
# Installation:
#   pip install -r requirements-face.txt
#
# Note: The application works without these dependencies.
# Face recognition features will be disabled if these are not installed.
